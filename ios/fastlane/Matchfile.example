# Matchfile for Fastlane Match
# This file is optional and mainly useful for local development
# 
# For CI/CD, Match configuration is passed via environment variables
# (see .github/workflows/cd-ios.yml)
#
# When you run `fastlane match init`, it creates a Matchfile automatically.
# This is an example template.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Copy Matchfile.example to Matchfile
# 2. Update the values below
# 3. Add Matchfile to .gitignore (it contains sensitive info)

# Git repository URL where certificates are stored
# For centralized repo with branch-per-app pattern:
git_url("https://github.com/IYCLLC/ms-ios-certs.git")

# Git branch for this app (use different branch per app)
# Uncomment and set your app-specific branch name
# git_branch("your-app-name")

# Storage mode: git, google_cloud, or s3
# storage_mode("git")

# Git basic authorization (Base64 encoded username:token)
# Uncomment and set if you want to use Match locally without env vars
# git_basic_authorization(Base64.strict_encode64("username:token"))

# App identifier (usually inherited from Appfile)
# app_identifier("com.speckit.flutterTemplate")

# Team ID (usually inherited from Appfile)
# team_id("YOUR_TEAM_ID")

# Username for App Store Connect (usually inherited from Appfile)
# username("your@email.com")
